This tool is for creating proxies for Trading Card Games.

Steps:

1. Run SETUP.bat. This will create the venv and images folder.
2. Fill the images folder with all of your proxies. I use www.mpcfill.com. When it output the PDF it will crop 1/8" from the proxy image.  
3. Run RUN_APP.bat. This will open the proxy editor.
4. In the proxy editor press Export PDF to create PDF.
5. Open the PDF in Chrome. In the advanced settings set the size to Letter to get correct sizing.
